A tribute website made in a mere 3 hours because I was too lazy to do my
assignments (it was math.)

I took some inspirations from
[this Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gfxindonesiamaker),
then I applied the design in my head in real-time (I didn't design anything
beforehand) with broken CSS, but the result is quite amazing not gonna lie.

~~Likely wouldn't work on mobile. Laptop or PC is recommended.~~

Added support for mobile, laptop or PC is still recommended though.
