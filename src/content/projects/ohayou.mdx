Just like the description says, it's a minimal start page. Basically, you use it
as your home page in your browser, then add your favorite websites and search
engine and then you're done!

I got the inspiration from my friends repositories:
- [RyaWcksn/search-site](https://github.com/RyaWcksn/search-site)
- [RyaWcksn/startpage](https://github.com/RyaWcksn/startpage)
- [kangnikol/startpage](https://github.com/kangnikol/startpage)

As for why I chose Svelte, because it was a trend at the time and I got carried
away, that's all.
