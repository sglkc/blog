# Story

This was my first ever time getting into a front-end framework, me and my
friends were told to learn Vue and make a website for the company.

We were very confused of course, since we didn't have any experience with
anything related to Node.js nor deploying a website to the internet. The
challenge given was just right, we didn't take it easy and we weren't
overwhelmed.

# Why the teck stack?

On why it's Nuxt, Vue, and Vuetify specifically is because "they" said it's the
easiest framework to learn for beginners. I mean, we couldn't refuse too, so
why not?

# Last words

I will and always miss those times. Shout out to the everyone behind Savikindo!
