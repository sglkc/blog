### I told you there's nothing to see here.

Anyway, the reason why I made this website (blog) is just so I can practice my
English and writing skills. Despite being a programmer who writes codes almost
daily, I rarely write something else. So here comes my attempt at writing.

I choose minimalist design for my website just because I can't be bothered to
design anything <small>(real)</small>. To be honest, I like the design so I
don't think I'll change it soon enough.

Jadi aku pikir kenapa pake bahasa Inggris? Bukannya biar keliatan sok Inggris
tapi kan sayang kalo bisa bahasa Inggris tapi ga dipake dikehidupan
sehari-hari, valid ga?

Ya gitu aja sih, bingung mau post apa jadi segini dulu ajh.
