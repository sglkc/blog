Another Japanese-centered website, I made because I'm a fanboy of Japan.

As mentioned in the README, I don't recommend this website if you really are
trying to learn Japanese, this is just a tech-demo for I was having fun with
these JavaScript Japanese libraries.

# Uhh why Browserify?

I kinda regret this decision, it made the development much slower. I didn't
know at the time that there are much better build tools than having to manually
build the script for every changes.

So as a personal note here: **DO NOT** use Browserify again, and just stick with a
better build tool like Vite.
