# Story

So this test I'm talking about was in 11-14 April, we were taking written test
and a case study where we have to make a website about Hotels.

I will include a quite important note that you, as a developer, has to remember.
Atleast that was what the examiner said.

## Admin Panel

The site has an admin panel inside of it, where you can play around with the API
and while the design is very bland and basic, I think the functionality is
enough to make it usable.

**So what was the important note?**

I completely forgot to add pagination. Yep, I think that was the only reason on
why I got smaller grade than I expected, so don't forget to have pagination if
you're dealing with a lot of data!

Yet another thing that was introduced to me, a JavaScript framework for Back-End
development. My close friends used this on their internship, so I got into it as
well.

This was the time I'm familiar with Laravel, the design pattern is quite similar
to it: controllers, middlewares, migrations. and routes.

I can say the security is too elaborate thanks to the best practices I've read
online.
