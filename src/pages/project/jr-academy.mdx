On this project, I introduced myself to mobile programming. At first I was very
nervous since I never had any experience with mobile applications, the tech
decide to use is React Native because it's one of the popular JavaScript
framework to build mobile apps.

Though, I never used React either so it was quite confusing but I managed to
get this application into production.

The libraries I used are Axios, React Navigation, React Redux, and several Expo
and React Native component libraries. Developing and building the app requires a
platform, so I used Expo.

This app connects to a back-end API I've made with Express. The API won't be
included in my projects portfolio since it doesn't have any screenshots.
