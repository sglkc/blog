It's basically this blog's project section, but a lot simpler.

The reason why I used plain HTML and JavaScript is because it won't be a hassle
for anyone to copy or modify it. You're free to clone the repository and make
your own portfolio with it, assuming you know how to style.

Viewing on mobile is not recommended.

After making this I realized how many Japanese-related things I've made :(

Made this in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I saw a very interesting
yet minimal design online.
