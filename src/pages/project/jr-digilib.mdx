Fully remade in React, this webiste delivers the same functionality as the
mobile app. In this website, the admin is able to add items into the database
and do some updates for several assets.

I chose the design to be similar with the mobile app as to minize confusion
both for developers and users. The libraries I used for this project are
Axios, PostCSS Nesting, React Redux, React Player, Draft.js, and a couple of
React components.

The website also connects to the same back-end API as the mobile app.

This website includes a text editor to write articles, powered by [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/)
