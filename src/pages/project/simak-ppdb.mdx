Source code is private, but you can still the demo while it's still live.

Working together with a friend, we were able to take a unique design concept
from the mockup and bring it to fruition through the use of Adobe XD. The
company's UI/UX Designer capabilities allowed us to precisely execute the
desired aesthetic.

Additionally, we utilized Vue.js as our JavaScript framework again and paired it
with BootstrapVue for the UI components, resulting in a cohesive and visually
stunning final product.
