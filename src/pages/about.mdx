# About Me

I go by the alias **sglkc** because I quite care about my online privacy
<small>(kind of)</small>. That means if you know me, you know me.

I'm a web developer based in **Indonesia**, I have a passion to be creative and
get innovative ideas to implement them in the web. It's either because I'm bored
or just because I think my idea would help the society albeit a little.

## Story

I got into the coding scene back in elementary school, at the time I was just
messing around with Windows Batch script, I had also made some animations, games
using Scratch, and a bit of HTML.

Fast forward, I formally developed my skill as a programmer in a vocational high
school as a Software Engineer. I loved web development because it was and will
always be very easy to get into.

## Programming Languages

While I mostly do web development, I was taught a couple of compiled languages,
that are **C++** and **Java**. I didn't continue my journey with them but I
think it's worth to mention.

It is self-evident that my favorite programming language is **JavaScript**.
Right at the time of writing, I'm learning **TypeScript**. Another language that
I've learned so far is **Python** but I have come to dislike it.

## Development Tech

### Front-End

I know a few of front-end frameworks, **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and
**Astro**. My favorite build tool is **Vite**, because it's the fastest one I've
ever used.

### Styling

As for the styling, I usually go with **CSS**, if not then it's **Bootstrap**,
I also look for another UI component frameworks at times. On to bigger projects,
I use **PostCSS** with plugins, or maybe just **Tailwind**.

### Back-End

Back then before I knew about Node.js, I used **PHP** and the **Laravel**
framework, but now I change over to **Express**. About databases, I always use
**MySQL**, but I do plan to use another database in the future, probably
**MongoDB**.

### Miscellaneous

Services that I use for hosting is either **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)**
or **[Vercel](https://vercel.net)**. I know how to manage domains,
a small Linux server, and also a cPanel.

I use **Linux Mint** as operating system and **NeoVim** for the code editor. And
obviously, I use **Git**.

## Recap

To summarize, here is the list of technologies that I have used so far:

- **Language:** C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript.
- **Front-End:** HTML, React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, Vite.
- **Style:** CSS, Bootstrap, PostCSS, Tailwind.
- **Back-End:** PHP, Laravel, Express.
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB.
- **Service:** Netlify, Vercel, cPanel.
- **Workspace:** Linux Mint, NeoVim, Git.

## Special Mention

I'm a self-taught Japanese language learner, I study for around 3 months then
I continue to learn passively, I'm positive that I could pass JLPT N5 but as of
now I haven't took an official test.

I try to be more engaged in concern of English, that's one of the reason on why
I write in English. Back in high school I took a TOIEC test and scored 885.

That's all. I think it has more than enough information for you to know, thanks
for coming and maybe reading, have a great day!
