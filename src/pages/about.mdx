Hello, it's me. I go by the alias **sglkc** here because I quite care about my
online privacy <small>(kind of)</small>. If you know me, you know me.

I'm a web developer based in **Indonesia**, I have a passion to get creative and
innovative ideas to implement them in the web. It's either because I'm bored or
just because I think my idea could help everyone.

I got into the coding scene back in elementary school, and formally developed
my skill as a programmer in vocational high school. I loved web development
because it was and will always be very easy to get into.

My favorite programming language is **JavaScript**. While I don't have a problem
with **HTML**, it's hard to maintain for bigger projects. The first ever
front-end framework I got into was **Vue**. Along with that, I have learned
other frameworks like **React**, **Svelte**, and **Astro**.

Smaller projects could work with plain **CSS**, but for style consistency and
better user interfaces, **Bootstrap** is enough. **Tailwind** is used in some
of my projects, and **Vuetify** for my Vue projects.

As for the back-end, I have experience working with **PHP** and the framework
**Laravel**. But it has been so long since I used PHP, that **Express** became
my best friend for developing **APIs**. I have always used **MySQL** for the
database, but I plan to use other databases in the future.

Being a **full-stack** developer means I could manage a small Linux server and
**cPanel** for web hosting, and setting up a domain with a hosting platform
like **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)** or **[Vercel](https://vercel.net)**.

I used **Linux** daily, my code editor and IDE is **NeoVim**, because I know
most NeoVim users are always winning. <small>(except i don't)</small>

Anyway as you can read. I speak English too. I took the **TOIEC** test back in
high school and I got a total score of **885**.

That's all. I think it has more than enough information for you to know, thanks
for coming and maybe reading, have a good day!
